type of ques asked and aproach to solve in diff question , approach for diff type of ques , concept


in exam , not much time to think, you should what should be correct exact apprach , no mistake , should know how to solve 
question exaclty 

ask basic and normal ques using this 
--give me some of the complex  matrix  problem to solve in java , which also clear my concept, give me code 

##################################################################################################################

basic concept 

1.(Object)d.getClass().getSimpleName() to know variable data type 


strategy for for loop 

1. simple for loop 

2. when inner loop start with value of i 

3- have another array which is made true and then on this condition , somethong checked or this array made 
true based on some codiiton  

4. use of math.max and min , math.floor ,math.abs 


while loop 

1. index is updated

2, when true is while condition 

3.some counter , on which while condiiton is based 

4. long (n*n) where n is int 

Arrays 

1.dynamic arrays 
with size counter, feeding element to array , suppose array has 100 lenght but adding elem in array based on 
this index counter 





string 

1. use contains to check some symbol 

2. use startwith and endwith to check if substring present in string, can be used in recusrion 

3.charat, matches , 

4.compare 2 string parallel, comparing adjacent character in same string 

if (str1.charAt(i) != str2.charAt(i)) {

5. replace or replaceall 

6.finding count of char in another string, is also , use while(index){increment index and count,till its -1}

7.   String d=String.join(" ",s2[0],s2[1]); System.out.println(d);  result is "pizza hawai"

8.string.join is opp of split where different string is joined by delimeter, which is first arg of string.join 


9. same to do with stringbuilder sb.append(str1).append(" ").append(str2);String result = sb.toString();


10. comparing string length , if 2 string same lenght , its being empty could be in base case 


matrix 

1.when asked to find avg across each row, divide by no of col and vice versa 

2.if sum across each row, cal sum for each row and then out of inner loop, add into some collection, if index required 
that too.


recusrion 

1. in base index of array and string should be less than leght of string or array, string should not be empty



dynamic programming 


map 

for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : wordCount.entrySet()) {
System.out.println(entry.getKey() + ": " + entry.getValue());

set 


list 



1.String reversedLine = new StringBuilder(line).reverse().toString(); -- directly reversing string using list functio 

2. List.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);



class 

1.after split in string array, may be u need to parse some part , create new object out of these variable 

2.when said 2 variable of any data type ,then for example left is of l type, right is of r type.


3. class Tuple<L, R> define and then when calling double squareDiv(Tuple<Integer, Integer> tuple) 

4.in one method , u declare a local variable and then return nothing, in this method ,just add this local into the class

variable like  Movie movie = new Movie(title, genres);
        movies.add(movie); in addmovie method ,in this  movies, is instance of object.


5. second , u return list or map and in this case , map is returned,

6. Pizza Hawaii  10.50 . the first 2 can be stored in string using string.join(" ",stringbiulder or list) 

you can also simply concat first 2 parts[0] + " " + parts[1]; 

7. they ask where they send string line to constructor , and then we have to parse it , create new object, throws 
exception sometimes  or reading a file doing the same thing for each line 



8.

exception 


inheritance


interface 

1.interface Container<T>

stack 


queue 


file operation 


1.use File file = new File("sample.txt"); and then BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file)))
 when file is not in same directory 

2. use of try () catch{}

3.  try (BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(file, true))) when we want to append file 

4. catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
