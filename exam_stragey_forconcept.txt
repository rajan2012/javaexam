in exam , not much time to think, you should what should be correct exact apprach , no mistake , should know how to solve 
question exaclty 

ask basic and normal ques using this 
--give me some of the complex  matrix  problem to solve in java , which also clear my concept, give me code

basic concept 




strategy for for loop 

1. simple for loop 

2. when inner loop start with value of i 

3- have another array which is made true and then on this condition , somethong checked or this array made 
true based on some codiiton  

4. use of math.max and min , math.floor ,math.abs 


while loop 

1. index is updated

2, when true is while condition 

3.some counter , on which while condiiton is based 

4. long (n*n) where n is int 

Arrays 

1.dynamic arrays 
with size counter, feeding element to array , suppose array has 100 lenght but adding elem in array based on 
this index counter 





string 


matrix 


recusrion 


dynamic programming 


map 

for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : wordCount.entrySet()) {
System.out.println(entry.getKey() + ": " + entry.getValue());

set 


list 


1.String reversedLine = new StringBuilder(line).reverse().toString(); -- directly reversing string using list functio 


exception 


inheritance


interface 



stack 


queue 


file operation 


1.use File file = new File("sample.txt"); and then BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file)))
 when file is not in same directory 

2. use of try () catch{}

3.  try (BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(file, true))) when we want to append file 

4. catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
